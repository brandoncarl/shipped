# leadship

leadship is your zero configuration front-end dream tool. By using sensible
defaults, and a handy CLI, you can get almost any dev-project up and running
with no work. Compilation pipelines are easy, and dependencies are hot-loaded.
As for the haters, you can of course override the config, we just try to make
it unnecessary.

For example, adding a Jade-Handlebars-HTML Minifier pipeline requires no grunts
and no gulps. Assuming we denote these with "jbs" extension, simply type:

`$ leadship pipelines:add *.jbs "jade>handlebars>html-minifier"`

The end goal is to fully automate front-end pipelines from development to
Dockerized microservice deployment with minimal configuration. We're not there
yet: this is the first step of many!

How do we do this with zero configuration? See below!


## Features

* Live browser refresh via [BrowserSync](https://github.com/Browsersync/browser-sync)  
* Automatic compilation of templating libraries (Jade, Handlebars, JSX, etc.)  
* Automatic compilation of transpile-to-JS language (CoffeeScript, LiveScript, etc.)  
* Automatic compilation of stylesheet languages (Less, Sass, Stylus)  
* Automatic bundling of single page apps via [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* No excess waste: compiled files are stored in-memory, leaving your file system pristine
* Support for advanced chaining of pipelines (CoffeeScript > Babel > UglifyJS)  
* JSON REST API via [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)  
* Cookie, session and environment variables  
* Database querying via [Universql](https://github.com/brandoncarl/universql)  
* Custom middleware built on [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
* Local and environment variables with advanced injection


## Installation

```
$ npm install -g leadship
```

## Zero Configuration

By using a core set of rules, we are able to use zero configuration.  

1. **Compilation pipelines are inferred from, and attached to file extensions.**
For example, `.coffee` files will be automatically transpiled by CoffeeScript,
`.ts` by TypeScript, `.hbs` by Handlebars, and so on. You can override these
settings using the CLI. For example, `$ leadship pipelines:add html dust`

2. **Route handlers are inferred from directory structure**. For example,
  ```
  views/
  └─ about/
  `  ├─ legal.jade
  `  └─ privacy.jade
  ```
  compiles jade into html for routes `/about/legal` and `/about/privacy`.

3. **Scripts named index.* will compile to single files via webpack**.
  ```
  scripts/
  └─ app/
  `  ├─ index.js
  `  ├─ helper.js
  `  └─ utils.js
  ```
  turns into `/scripts/app.js`.

4. **HTML files named `template` turn into wildcard routes**.
  ```
  views/
  └─ posts/
  `  └─ template.html
  ```
  turns into `/posts/:$slug`, where query is passed into your templating engine.
  Note that this also applies to HTML-like files.

5. **JSON in your `data` directory will be swallowed into your server**.
  If the JSON file is an array, it can be queried using the filename and path.
  If it an object, the keys function as paths (including folder). Let's see an example:
  ```bash
  data/
  ├─ music.json         # Contains { "artists" : [...], "albums" : [...] }
  └─ api/
     └─ users.json   # Contains [user1, user2, user3]
  ```
  Yields the routes: `/artists`, `/albums`, and `/api/users`. Note that since
  `music.json` contained an object, its keys give the route. Meanwhile, since
  `users.json` contained an array, the route is determined from the filename. In
  both cases, the parent directory is used as a prefix.

6. **HTML files can have DATA metadata using Universql**
  ```html
  <html>
  <!-- DATA=api/albums?id={{$slug}} -->
  <head>
  ...
  </html>
  ```
  This is a fairly advanced topic and needs to be covered in more detail.

## Recommended Directory Structure

Not only does leadship cover many directory structures automatically, you can
use the CLI or `leadship.json` file to roll-your-own.

Here's what we recommend:

```bash
project/
├─ data/        # (alt: json)
├─ fonts/       # (alt: type)
├─ images/
├─ scripts/     # (alt: js)
├─ styles/      # (alt: css)
├─ vendor/      # (alt: components)
└─ views/

```
Note that `scripts` contain your own JavaScript and `vendor` contains third-party.
Third-party JavaScript is assumed to be precompiled and is handled as static files.

## Special Variables

The following variables are attached to the templating context and should be
treated as reserved: `$query`, `$params`, `$data`, `$slug`, `$cookies`, `$session`.
They correspond to the related `req` variables in express. `$slug` is used
only for templates and contains the wildcard portion of the URL.


## CLI
